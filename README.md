# Everybody Else Is Paranoid



## They're not watching you (plural), they're watching YOU (singular).
## Log in to have all your suspicions confirmed.

A Project by: Ollo Clark

Everybody Else Is Paranoid (EEIP) is a tongue-in-cheek, governmental dystopian
MERN app, designed to play on user expectations. Upload a profile picture?
Why? Just because they told you to? Tell them your email? Just because they asked?

Continued development will add to, and gamify, more aspects of .gov banality.




## Technologies used:

HTML, CSS, JSX, React, Express, Node.js, Nodemon, Mongoose, MongoDB,
Amazon AWS.
## Getting Started:

-link to deployed app: https://everybodyelseisparanoid.herokuapp.com/
-link to Trello board: https://trello.com/b/XJ7fDce8/everyone-else-is-paranoid
## Next Steps:

- Add more Math.random capabilities
- Continue to work on CSS
- Gamify log in and info process
- Allow snoops to influence how often a suspect appears
